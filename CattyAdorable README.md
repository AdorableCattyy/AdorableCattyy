☆ ⁠˖ Some things about me I guess ! ::

• I have social anxiety, and even online, I am still uncomfortable with strangers .. So I mainly have my status to DNIUF or DNIUCF.

• English is not my first language and I'm not exactly good at it, so please correct me if I made mistakes.

• Sometimes I have crowd/cover discomfort, so please don't cover me if you're not my friend !

• I can't handle changes very well.

• I have a habit of remembering my friends speech pattern, and then I will get uncomfortable if they suddenly changed the way they speak, because to me, it seemed like I'm not talking to them anymore.

• I don't really like making new friends, socialing is not really my speciality. I prefer to talk to the friends I already made.

• I can get very selfish and petty at times, so I may be hard to handle.

• If we're talking and you suddenly wanted to invite your friends, I will most likely say no. I got jealous so easily and seeing my friends having fun with others made me jealous, but I won't say anything about me being jealous most of the time.

• I tend to talk a lot, especially about my interests ! So please ask me about my interests if you want me to yap about them !

• I use tonetags a lot ! I found it hard to describe what I'm feeling in texts, so I use tonetags to do that !

• I also would prefer you to use tonetags around me, you don't actually have to but I would prefer if you do !
