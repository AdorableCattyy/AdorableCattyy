☆ ⁠˖ Some things about me I guess ! ::

• I have social anxiety, and even online, I am still uncomfortable with strangers, that's why I mostly set my status to DNIUF or DNIUCF.

• I tend to talk a lot ! Especially about my insterests <3

• English is not my first language and I'm not exactly good at it, so please correct me if I made mistakes !

• I sometimes have Crowd / Cover discomfort ! So don't cover me if you're not my friend !

• I mostly afk a lot on PonyTown, so Whispering to Interact is more recommended !

• I can't handle changes very well.

• I have a habit of remembering my friends speech pattern, and I will get uncomfortable when they suddenly changed the way they speak, because to me, I feel like I'm not talking to them anymore

• I don't like making new friends, socializing is not my speciality. I prefer to talk to the friends I already have.

• I can be very selfish and petty at times, so I could be hard to handle.

• If we're talking and you suddenly want to invite your friend, I will likely say no. I got extreme jealousy and got jealous so easily when I saw my friends having fun with others, but I will mostly not mentioned anything about my jealousy.

• I use tonetags a lot ! I found it hard to describe what I'm feeling through texts, so I use tonetags to do that !

• Please do use tonetags with me ! You don't actually have to but I would appreciate it if you do !
